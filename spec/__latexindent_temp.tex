\section{Introduction}


This language allows drummers to notate drums efficiently, without using inconvenient intermediary software. As it can be tedious to write drum tabs in UIs that are not designed for this purpose, this language lets users write drum tabs in a simple and intuitive way: by utilizing the good old "1 e and a" counting system. 


\item

A drum part's structure is often constant throughout a song, with only slight variations across its parts (intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, etc.). This language also helps to avoid repetition by allowing the user to write one structure only once, then reuse it in other parts with slight modifications if necessary.

\section{Design Principles}

The most important design principle in this language is the fact that users can create and re-use patterns, bars, and beats that can be easily modified when writing the tabs. Perhaps in the future, users will be able to share the source code for each song written in this programming language on a platform similar to GitHub, where they can keep track of their commits, collaborators, etc. Further, the platform will contain a built-in editor and a visual display of the tabs that can be directly played.



\section{Examples}

\subsection{Example 1}
It is very easy to create a pattern, just by using the "1 e and a" counting system. 
We put separators \verb+|+ to disambiguate the division of the beats.
\begin{verbatim}
    time: 4/4
    division: 1/16
    
    title: my title
    subtitle: my subtitle
    
    pattern mypattern : 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
    
    render: mypattern
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{example1.png}


\subsection{Example 2}
Simple example of creating a one measure beat.
\begin{verbatim}
    time :  4/4
    division: 1/16
    
    title: example 2
    subtitle: example 2
    
    pattern mypattern : 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
    
    
    bar mybar1:
        hh: [ 1 + | 2  + | 3 + | 4  + | ]
        sn: [ mypattern ]
        bd: [ 1 a | 2 a | 3 a | 4 a |]
    
    
    render: mybar1    
\end{verbatim}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{example2.png}

\subsection{Example 3}
Create a beat by repeating the pre-defined measure 4 times and adding a crash cymbal 
on the first beat and changing the pattern of the bass drum. Also repeat the bar 2 times
without any change instructions: 
\begin{verbatim}
    time :  4/4
    division: 1/16
    
    title: example 3
    subtitle: example 3
    
    pattern mypattern : 1 e + a | 2  e + a  | 3 e + a  | 4  e + a  |
    
    bar mybar1:
        hh: [ mypattern ]
        sn: [ | 2 |  | 4 |]
        bd: [ 1 + | 2  + | 3 + | 4 + |]
    
    Snippet mysnippet:
        
        @change 4: 
            mybar1 (1,4) {
                cc: [1 |]
                bd: [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |]
            };
    
        !repeat 2: [ mybar1 ].
    
    render: mysnippet
\end{verbatim}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{example3.png}

\section{Language Concepts}
There are two core concepts a user should understand in order to write programs in this language. First, how to notate different parts of the drum-set. Below is an example of a basic drum kit and the corresponding abbreviations we will use to write programs.

\begin{verbatim}
CC = Crash cymbal
HH = Hi-hat
RD = Ride cymbal
SN = Snare drum
T1 = High tom
T2 = Low tom
FT = Floor tom
BD = Bass drum
\end{verbatim}

There are also different techniques to play these, such as playing the bell of ride (rd[b]), open hi-hats (o), slightly open hi-hats (\verb+~+), closed hi-hats (hh by default or x), foot hi-hats (\verb+_+), ghost notes (g), flams (f), rimshots (r), accented strokes (a) etc. 

Secondly, a user should be familiar with the “1 e and a” counting system:
\\\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img.png}

Now knowing this, we can assign patterns to each part of the drum kit. For example, in 4/4 time, we can assign to SN (the snare drum) the pattern \verb+1 e | 2 | | 4 a |+, where $|$ just symbolises division of the beat (not necessarily if it is unambiguous).


\section{Syntax}

A pattern is made up of notes. Patterns can be 
assigned to drums in a bar. Bars can be combined to create
a beat. Bars inside a beat can be repeated and modified inside 
a repeat instruction. 
Notes are primitives, which have values 1 e + a.
Patterns have string names.
Bars have string names.
Beats have string names.
Repeat instruction accepts an integer as the value
of how many times to repeat a bar. It also accepts an optional
an argument that represents which bar to modify. Properties to 
modify are specified inside curly brackets. Modifying 
properties is similar to assigned patterns to drums. Can also
keep the pattern the same but change the drum from one to another by 
using the \verb+->+ sign.

    A way of writing notes: 1 specifies a strong beat, e is a weak beat, + is a strong beat, 
    and a is a weak beat. Any of these notes (or even no notes at all), make up one beat. 
    As defined by the time signature above, if we combine 4 beats then we get one full measure (ex: 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a).
    We put a separator \verb+|+ after each beat to disambiguate the division of the beats:

\section{Remaining Work}
The only thing remaining now is figuring out how to
display rests and the beaming of notes. The distance of
notes evaluates and displayes correctly, but I just need to
add the beams and rests as necessary.

In addition, for a stretch goal there's a webapp where
users can edit and play the pieces they wrote.
